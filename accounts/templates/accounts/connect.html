    <h2>SceneID logged in as {{ user_data.display_name }}</h2>
    <p>You successfully logged in with your SceneID as <b>{{ user_data.display_name }}</b>, but it's not connected to a Demosite account yet.
    If you already had a Demosite account, you can log in to it and you'll be able to use both login methods from then on.
    If you don't have a Demosite account, you can create a new one without having to use a password to log in.</p>
